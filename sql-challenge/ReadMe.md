This work consists of creating tables and querying them.

The tables that were created:
1. Employees
2. Departments
3. Titles
4. Dept_emp
Dept_manager
salaries

The observations on the datafiles
Title:
In the Titles files there shouldbe a master table with the Titles to store along wiht IDS.
with the current structure. if the employee changes the titles then we are not sure to overwrite the same entry again that would potentially loose the previous employment details.
the same logic apply to the dept_emp too.
